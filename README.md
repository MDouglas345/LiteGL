# LiteGL
Just a simple wrapper that objectifies common graphics elements for ease of use and readability. It is meant to make the process of getting graphics on the screen quick and easy while maintaining some level of control over memory on the GPU.
This is the foundation of something else that will utilize these functionalities.
Currently only supports OpenGL.

#Goals
Create a better interface so that extended to Vulkan is easy
